# Drinks Machine

For a few years I had the idea of making a "drinks machine". The idea I had in mind was the following:
### Software
 * The machine has a list of recipes stored in the embedded system
 * You could select the individual beverages you have and the system will use those beverages to filter the available recipes
 * You select your drink from the list of available recipes and the machine will do the rest

### Hardware
 * For the beverages I could use some [peristaltic pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristaltic_pump) with food safe silicone tubing
 * For the user interface a Raspberry Pi with a capacitive touch screen seems to be the perfect match

The idea looks relatively _simple_ from the software persepective, but from the hardware side it implied a big challenge for me... but I was ready for it.

Without any mechanic engenieering experience whatsoever I decided to design my own peristaltic pumps using Fusion 360 and a stepper motor instead of buying them :rofl:. As you can imagine, it was not an easy task... AT ALL.

I went for so many ~~fails~~ designs:
